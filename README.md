# PXL Node.js Framework

## Installation

Clone this repository and switch to the project specific Node.js version:

```sh
nvm use
```

## Use library in project

### Publish using Yalc

Use [Yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) to publish the library for local usage using the following command:

```sh
yalc publish
```

### Import in project

After the library has been published with **Yalc**, add it to a project with the following command:

```sh
yalc add @pxl/nodejs-framework
```

And start using in project:

```ts
import { Application } from '@pxl/nodejs-framework';

const app = new Application({
  // ...
});
```

## Development

Run the following command to automatically publish changes through **Yalc** when files are being changed:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated using TypeDoc and deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

### Local Documentation Development

To generate and view documentation locally:

```sh
npm run docs
```

This will generate the documentation in the `docs/` folder. You can then open `docs/index.html` in your browser.

### Automated Documentation Deployment

Documentation is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages when:
- Code is pushed to the `main` or `master` branch
- Pull requests are opened against `main` or `master` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch is triggered

The documentation will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

> **Note**: The `docs/` folder is gitignored and should not be committed to the repository as it's automatically generated by the CI/CD pipeline.
